# leader-ly
An open source application to manage your organization's relationships and sales leads


 -This application will let you add an individual
 -That data entry will have three values:
        -How influential the individual is.
        -How much affinity the individual already has for the organization
        -How likely it is that outreach would influence the individual


This application will help political campaigns and sales teams effectively target their resources where they are most likely to have an impact.

-Help campaigns evaluate reporters to pitch stories.
-Help sales teams identify the best leads

-Track lead development over time: has the client become more or less receptive to your product/message? Has a blogger become more influential over time and therefore a higher priority for outreach?
-Help teams keep track of everyone they are currently engaging with and log outcome results.

This application is an open source collaboration produced by the GA Web Development Immersive Students of the Meerkats cohort.
